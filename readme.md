# Cellular

A simple phisical engine inspired by conways game of life.

Use arrow keys to chang number of cells. R to reset. H to add food. N to spawn cell. I to turn info on/off. Clik on cell to show info about it.

Just run index.html to play. There is live demo avalible on [my website](https://okkindel.github.io/cellular/). Have fun.
